# Guess-the-number

This is a test task for an Android Developer position, requiring the creation of three screens for a simple game. 

Screen 1 is the menu screen, displaying a title and two buttons. 
The "Start game" button redirects the user to the second screen, which is the game screen. 
The "Exit the application" button closes the app. 

Screen 2 is the game screen, featuring a title and a simple game, such as "Guess the Number." 
The user enters their guesses using an EditText field, and clicks a check button to verify their answer. 
A TextView displays whether their guess is correct or not. Once verified, an "End Game" button appears, leading to the third screen. 

Screen 3 is the results screen, showing the game results with a heading. A TextView displays the number of correct and incorrect guesses. 
The "Return to menu" button takes the user back to the first screen to start a new game or exit the app. 

Overall, this task requires creating three screens with different functionalities for a simple game.
